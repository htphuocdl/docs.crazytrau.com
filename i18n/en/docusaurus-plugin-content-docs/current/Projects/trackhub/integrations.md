## Internal

- Between mini-apps and host: context/SDK; clear contracts, no UI coupling.

## External

- Payment, social login, maps, push notifications.

## API Management

- Rate limiting, API keys, gateway policy, versioning.

## Event-driven

- Kafka/RabbitMQ (planned): standardized topics, schema (Avro/JSON Schema).
