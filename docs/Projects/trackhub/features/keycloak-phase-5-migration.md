# Phase 5: User Migration & Deprecation

**Phase ID**: `PHASE-KEYCLOAK-005`  
**Status**: `TODO[]`  
**Start Date**: TBD (After Phases 1-4)  
**Target Completion**: TBD  
**Dependencies**: All previous phases completed

## Overview

Migrate existing users from custom authentication system to Keycloak, ensure data integrity, and deprecate old authentication code while maintaining backward compatibility during transition.

## Objectives

- [ ] Create user migration script
- [ ] Migrate user accounts to Keycloak
- [ ] Migrate user passwords (hashed) or require password reset
- [ ] Migrate user attributes and metadata
- [ ] Verify migration integrity
- [ ] Deprecate old authentication code
- [ ] Monitor migration success and errors
- [ ] Communicate migration to users

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 5.1: User Migration Script Development

**Status**: `TODO[]`  
**Assignee**: Backend  
**Estimated Effort**: 1.5 weeks

#### Checklist
- [ ] Analyze existing user database schema
- [ ] Map existing user fields to Keycloak user attributes:
  - [ ] Email → `email`
  - [ ] Username → `username`
  - [ ] Password hash → migrate or reset
  - [ ] `tenantId` → custom attribute
  - [ ] `projectId` → custom attribute
  - [ ] `roleId` → Keycloak roles
  - [ ] Profile data → custom attributes
- [ ] Create migration script:
  - [ ] Read users from existing database
  - [ ] Create users in Keycloak via Admin API
  - [ ] Map attributes correctly
  - [ ] Handle password migration (if possible) or reset required
  - [ ] Handle conflicts (duplicate emails, usernames)
  - [ ] Log migration progress
  - [ ] Generate migration report
- [ ] Implement dry-run mode (no actual migration)
- [ ] Implement batch processing (migrate in chunks)
- [ ] Implement rollback capability
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Test migration script with test data

#### Acceptance Criteria (AC)
- ✅ Migration script created and tested
- ✅ User fields mapped correctly to Keycloak
- ✅ Batch processing works (configurable chunk size)

## Migration Strategy

### Staged Rollout

1. **Week 1**: Test users (10-20 users)
2. **Week 2**: Beta users (100-200 users)
3. **Week 3**: 10% of production users
4. **Week 4**: 25% of production users
5. **Week 5**: 50% of production users
6. **Week 6**: Remaining users

### Rollback Plan

- Keep old authentication system running during migration
- Feature flag allows switching back if needed
- Monitor for critical issues
- Rollback if error rate > 5% or critical bugs found

## Dependencies

### External
- Keycloak server stable and tested
- Backup infrastructure ready

### Internal
- All previous phases completed
- Migration scripts tested
- Support team trained

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | Critical | Comprehensive backups, verification scripts |
| User login issues | High | Staged rollout, quick rollback capability |
| Password migration failures | Medium | Reset strategy, clear communication |
| Performance issues | Medium | Batch processing, monitoring |

## Definition of Done

Phase 5 is considered complete when:

- [ ] All tasks (5.1 - 5.7) marked as `TODO[x]` (completed)
- [ ] All users migrated to Keycloak
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Old authentication code deprecated
- [ ] Users can login via Keycloak
- [ ] Migration success rate > 99%
- [ ] No critical issues for 2 weeks post-migration
- [ ] Monitoring in place
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team sign-off received

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
- Monitor authentication metrics
- Address user support tickets
- Fix any migration-related bugs

### Short-term (Month 1)
- Optimize Keycloak configuration based on usage
- Fine-tune token lifetimes
- Update user documentation based on feedback

### Long-term (Month 2-3)
- Consider additional features (MFA, risk-based auth)
- Performance optimization
- Security audit

## Success Metrics

- **Migration Success Rate**: > 99%
- **User Login Success Rate**: > 99.5%
- **Token Validation Latency**: < 50ms (p95)
- **User Satisfaction**: > 4/5 (survey)
- **Support Tickets**: < 5% of migrated users

## Conclusion

Phase 5 completes the Keycloak integration epic. After completion, all users will be on Keycloak authentication, and the old authentication system will be deprecated. Continuous monitoring and optimization will ensure smooth operation.
